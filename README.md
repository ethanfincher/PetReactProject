# Pet pages

## Technologies Used

I used JS, HTML, CSS, and the react library (within react useState, useEffect, and react-router-dom), as well as a couple of giphies  

## Getting Started/Installation Instructions

The site is pretty self explanatory, use the links in the top to navigate through the site, when on an info tab use the drop down to pick your breed and then just observe the info, for random cats just pick a catagory and scroll through the pictures, you can hit the more button for more cats. From github, you can fork the repo for the program (repo url here), then clone it into a local and open that in an IDE
